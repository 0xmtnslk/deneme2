# Upbit Monitoring Configuration
# UPBIT_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS: How often to check Upbit (TOTAL rate, not per proxy)
# Testing: 300ms (3.33 req/sec) - target for 0.3s detection
# Rate formula: 1000 / INTERVAL = req/sec (e.g., 300ms = 3.33 req/sec)
UPBIT_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS=300

# Upbit Proxies (SOCKS5) - RANDOM PROXY ROTATION
# The system picks a random proxy every UPBIT_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS
# More proxies = better IP distribution, less per-proxy load
# System supports up to 100 proxies (UPBIT_PROXY_1 through UPBIT_PROXY_100)
# Add as many as you need - system will auto-detect and use them
UPBIT_PROXY_1=socks5://username:password@ip1:port
UPBIT_PROXY_2=socks5://username:password@ip2:port
UPBIT_PROXY_3=socks5://username:password@ip3:port
# ... add more proxies as needed (UPBIT_PROXY_4, UPBIT_PROXY_5, etc.)
# UPBIT_PROXY_20=socks5://username:password@ip20:port
# UPBIT_PROXY_50=socks5://username:password@ip50:port
# UPBIT_PROXY_100=socks5://username:password@ip100:port

# Upbit Monitor Pause Schedule (Timezone-based)
# Automatically pause monitoring during non-trading hours
# This saves bandwidth, proxy quota, and focuses on active listing times
# 
# RECOMMENDED SETTINGS FOR UPBIT (Korean Exchange):
# - Timezone: Asia/Seoul (KST = UTC+9)
# - Active Hours: 08:55 - 19:05 KST (weekdays only)
# - Pause: 19:05 - 08:55 KST (nights) + weekends (Fri 19:05 - Mon 08:55)
#
# WHY THESE HOURS?
# - Upbit listings typically happen during business hours (09:00-19:00 KST)
# - 08:55-19:05 gives 5-min buffer before/after
# - Weekends are automatically paused (very rare listings)
