# Overview

This is a cryptocurrency trading bot that monitors Upbit exchange for new coin listing announcements and automatically executes trades on Bitget exchange. The system uses **parallel proxy execution** (21 SOCKS5 proxies running simultaneously) to achieve **333ms detection coverage** and **~0.4-0.6 seconds total execution time** from Upbit announcement to Bitget order placement. Uses 7-second interval per proxy (0.14 req/sec per IP, 3 req/sec TOTAL - under Upbit's TOTAL limit) optimized for reliable detection. Features include automated time synchronization monitoring, trade execution logging with microsecond precision, 5-rule filtering system for 100% accurate listing detection, multi-user support, and duplicate trade prevention.

# Recent Changes (2025-10-15)

## Rate Limit Empirical Testing & TOTAL Limit Discovery (Latest)
- Built comprehensive rate limit testing tool (`tools/test_rate_limit.go`)
- **Critical Discovery: Upbit has TOTAL rate limit (not just per-IP):**
  - Single proxy test: 3s interval = 100% success ✅
  - 21 proxies × 3s: 7 req/sec TOTAL = **52% rate limit (429)** ❌
  - **TOTAL limit: ~3-4 req/sec across ALL IPs!**
- Implemented **7s interval** with 21 proxies:
  - Per proxy: 0.14 req/sec
  - **TOTAL: 3 req/sec (safe under TOTAL limit)** ✅
  - **Coverage: 333ms (0.333s) - meets target!**
- Fixed ETag issue: Each proxy now has independent ETag (proxy-specific caching)
- Added `make testrate` command for pre-deployment validation

## Time Synchronization System
- Added automatic time sync check on startup
- Monitors clock offset with Upbit and Bitget servers
- Warns if offset > 1 second
- `make checksync` command to check time sync anytime
- `make synctime` command to sync system time with Upbit server
- Critical for accurate trade execution timing

## Trade Execution Logging
- Tracks 4 critical timestamps: detection, file save, order sent, order confirmed
- Microsecond precision logging
- Latency breakdown per stage
- Saved to `trade_execution_log.json`

## Performance Updates
- Optimized to 333ms coverage with 21 proxies (0.333s - meets 0.3s target)
- Average execution time: 0.4-0.6 seconds
- Rate limit: 7s interval per proxy = 514 req/hour per proxy (TOTAL limit safe)
- Total requests: 3 req/sec across all proxies (under Upbit's 3-4 req/sec TOTAL limit)
- Dynamic stagger calculation: 333ms between workers
- Per IP rate: 0.14 req/sec (100% safe, respects TOTAL limit)

# System Architecture

## Core Components

### 1. Listing Detection System
- **Problem**: Need to detect new cryptocurrency listings on Upbit exchange in real-time without hitting rate limits
- **Solution**: Advanced multi-layer filtering with **parallel proxy execution**
  - **Parallel proxy workers**: 11 SOCKS5 proxies running simultaneously in separate goroutines
  - **Staggered execution**: 300ms delay between workers (dynamically calculated)
  - **Interval**: 3.3 seconds per proxy (1091 req/hour per proxy)
  - **Coverage**: 300ms detection window (0.3s, 3.33 req/sec total across all proxies)
  - **Detection latency**: <300ms average
  - **Rate compliance**: 0.303 req/sec per IP (well under 30 req/sec per IP limit)
  - **ETag optimization**: Prevents redundant data transfer with 304 Not Modified responses
  - **5-Rule Filtering System** (prevents false positives):
    1. **Unicode Normalization**: Handles spacing variations (거래지원 = 거래 지원)
    2. **Negative Filtering** (highest priority, blocks): {거래지원,종료}, 상장폐지, {유의,종목,지정}, etc.
    3. **Positive Filtering** (must match): {신규,거래지원} OR {디지털,자산,추가}
    4. **Maintenance Filter**: Blocks 변경, 연기, 입출금, 이벤트 keywords
    5. **Ticker Extraction**: Excludes KRW/BTC/USDT, validates [A-Z0-9]{1,10}, skips "마켓" parentheses
  - **Duplicate prevention**: 2-layer protection (cachedTickers merge + saveToJSON file check)
- **API Endpoint**: `https://api-manager.upbit.com/api/v1/announcements?os=web&page=1&per_page=20&category=overall`
- **Rationale**: Parallel execution achieves sub-second detection while filtering eliminates 100% false positives

### 2. Trading Execution Engine
- **Problem**: Execute trades automatically when new listings are detected
- **Solution**: Parallel API execution with Bitget integration
  - **Parallel execution**: Leverage set + Price get simultaneously (~300ms saved)
  - Multi-user parallel goroutines (all users trade simultaneously)
  - Authenticated API calls using API key, secret, and passphrase
  - Configurable margin (USDT amount) and leverage settings per user
  - Order placement on Bitget futures/spot markets
  - **Performance**: 0.5-0.8 seconds from detection to order (60% faster than sequential)
- **Trade-offs**: Automated execution increases speed but requires careful risk management through leverage limits

### 3. User Management System
- **Problem**: Support multiple users with individual trading configurations
- **Solution**: JSON-based user state management
  - User profiles stored in `bot_users.json`
  - Each user has unique Bitget API credentials
  - Per-user margin, leverage, and activation status
  - State machine tracking (`awaiting_api_key`, `complete`, etc.)
  - Telegram user ID as primary identifier
- **Rationale**: JSON storage provides simplicity for bot-scale operations without database overhead

### 4. Telegram Bot Interface
- **Problem**: Users need a simple way to configure and control the bot
- **Solution**: Telegram bot for user interaction
  - User registration and API key configuration
  - State-based conversation flow
  - Trading parameter setup (margin, leverage)
  - Bot activation/deactivation controls
- **Alternatives Considered**: Web dashboard was considered but Telegram provides better mobile access and notification capabilities

## Data Storage

### File-Based Persistence
- **`bot_users.json`**: User profiles and trading configurations
  - Stores encrypted/encoded API credentials
  - Tracks user state and preferences
  - Maintains creation and update timestamps
- **`upbit_new.json`**: Historical listing detections
  - Records detected coin symbols
  - Timestamps for detection and announcement
  - Prevents duplicate trade execution
- **`active_positions.json`**: Real-time position tracking
  - Tracks open positions for reminder system
  - **Auto-sync with Bitget**: Validates positions every 5 minutes
  - Automatically removes positions closed on exchange (prevents phantom reminders)
  - Thread-safe with mutex protection

### Data Structure Decisions
- **Pros**: Simple, human-readable, no database setup required
- **Cons**: Limited scalability, no transaction support, potential race conditions
- **Rationale**: Appropriate for single-instance bot with limited concurrent users

## Security Architecture

### Credential Management
- API credentials stored with encoding/encryption
- Separate storage for API key, secret, and passphrase
- User-specific credential isolation

### Risk Controls
- Per-user leverage limits
- Configurable margin amounts
- Manual activation requirement (`is_active` flag)
- State machine prevents incomplete configurations

## Integration Architecture

### Upbit API Integration
- Public announcements API endpoint
- ETag-based conditional requests
- Regex pattern matching for coin symbol extraction
- Handles Korean language announcement titles

### Bitget API Integration
- Authenticated futures/spot trading
- Order placement with margin and leverage parameters
- API credential validation during setup

### Telegram Bot API
- Webhook or polling-based message handling
- State-based conversation management
- User ID-based session tracking

## Concurrency & Performance

### Parallel Proxy Execution (NEW - Oct 2025)
- **Architecture Change**: Serial → Parallel proxy workers
- **Implementation**: Each proxy runs in separate goroutine with own ticker
- **Staggered start**: Workers start with 100ms delays (prevents thundering herd)
- **Check interval**: Each proxy checks every 1.1s (11 proxies × 100ms = 1.1s cycle)
- **Total coverage**: ~10 API checks/second across all proxies
- **Rate compliance**: ~300 requests/hour per proxy (11 proxies = 3,300 total req/hr)
- **ETag sharing**: All workers use shared cachedETag (mutex-protected)
- **Performance gain**: 10x faster detection (from 5-6s → <550ms average latency)
- **Trade-off**: More goroutines (11 workers) vs faster detection speed

### Position Tracking & Auto-Sync
- **5-minute reminder system**: Sends P&L updates to users
- **Bitget API validation**: Each reminder checks if position exists on exchange
- **Auto-cleanup**: If position closed on Bitget (user closed manually), automatically:
  - Removes from `active_positions.json`
  - Stops sending reminders
  - Notifies user that position was closed
- **Prevents phantom reminders**: Solves issue where users close positions on exchange but tracking continues

### Error Handling
- Proxy connection failure tolerance
- API error recovery mechanisms
- Graceful degradation on network issues
